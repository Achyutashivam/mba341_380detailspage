Hostel were really good, we miss our rooms in fact, 2 sharing rooms with attached bathroom, with daily housekeeping staff. Mess food was best as we had all kind of cuisines included in it as the mess was student driven, we had a separate student mess committee who sit and decide every weeks menu and make it as per the average students choice of interest. There were regular feedback and suggestions taken from students for any improvements. We had canteen + night canteen where students could order their choice of interest. SIU has a separate medical facility hospital at every branch, so we had a dedicated medical officer and nurse who were available 24*7 within the campus. We had 2 ambulance in case of any emergency for reaching the nearest medical hospital. We have a good sporting space, separate football ground, cricket ground, volleyball, basketball, mini football court, kho space within the campus, we used to have regular inter college sports event. We have indoor carrom board, chess, table tennis, badminton courts."

Your prospects, however, will be influenced by a number of things, such as the degree you are applying to, how well you do on other admission examinations, and your extracurricular involvement. Ganpat University stipulates that a minimum of 45% of the class 12th aggregate, with 40% going to reserved categories, is needed for undergraduate programs. But certain well-liked programs, like engineering and medical, could have little more higher cutoffs."
